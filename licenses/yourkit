RESTRICTED USE OF EARLY ACCESS SOFTWARE
YourKit Early Access Program (EAP) is the easiest way to get in touch with the latest technologies from
YourKit. Within the EAP You can get an early access to new products and internal builds of future versions
of YourKit software ("Early Access Software").
NOTE: EARLY ACCESS SOFTWARE IS A PREVIEW SOFTWARE AIMED AT PROVIDING YOU
WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THE NEWEST FEATURES SCHEDULED FOR THE NEXT
MAJOR RELEASE. YOURKIT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS SOFTWARE WILL RUN
TROUBLE-FREE. USING THIS SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND DOES NOT
ENTITLE YOU TO ANY CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
You have a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to load and execute a copy of the Early Access Software
for a limited period of time. You must immediately cease using the Early Access Software and delete all its
copies as soon as one of the following conditions is met, whichever comes first:
(i) the Early Access Program for this Software version is over; this usually, but not necessarily, implies that
an official release is made available;
(ii) more than 90 days have passed since the date of particular Early Access Software build release date and a
newer Early Access build is available;
(iii) the Early Access Software may contain a feature that automatically disables the Software after some

RESTRICTED USE ON SOME PLATFORMS
The Software may be used on any supported platform with the restriction described below. There are socalled advanced platforms, which include AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux on PPC (PPC 32-bit, PPC 64-bit
big and little endian). The Software may run on an advanced platform, a JVM running on an advanced
platform may be profiled (i.e. a running JVM may be connected), and results obtained on an advanced 
platform may be analyzed (i.e. a snapshot of a JVM running on an advanced platform may be opened or
exported) only if the license is with the advanced support level. Hence, a license with the basic support level
does not entitle profiling on the advanced platforms.
