# bombo82-overlay


This is my own gentoo overlay, so none of these ebuilds will have official support.

## Installation

You can use this overlay by adding a file to `/etc/portage/repos.conf/` containing the following:
```bash
[bombo82]
priority = 50
location = /opt/portage/bombo82
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/bombo82/bombo82-overlay.git
auto-sync = Yes
```

Or add it from layman;
```bash
# layman -f -a bombo82
```
